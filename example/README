This directory contains sample NMR spectra and assignment data for
demonstating the NMR assignment and integration program Sparky.
Because this data set is distributed over the internet it contains
only a fraction of the data used to determine the structure of the
25mer TAT petitide.  Thanks to Anwer Mujeeb at UC San Francisco for
contributing the data.

	data/example100.ucsf	- part of 100 ms noesy spectrum (UCSF format)
	data/example250.ucsf	- part of 250 ms noesy spectrum (UCSF format)

	Save/example100.ucsf	- Sparky assignments (Sparky format)
	Save/example250.ucsf	- Sparky assignments (Sparky format)

	Projects/example.proj	- Sparky project containing 2 spectra

	TATpeptide.pdb		- structure (Protein Data Bank format)

You can view this data by using the Sparky open project command under the
file menu.  You will need to start Sparky from the directory that contains
this "example/" directory.  (This is necessary because the files in the
Save and Projects subdirectories contain file paths like
"example/data/example100.ucsf" which will not be valid unless the current
directory contains the example directory.)  See the README file in the
distribution directory for a crash course on using Sparky.
