# When a Sparky session starts the initilize_session() routines are invoked
# from the following files.
#
#       sparky_site.py - site initialization file
#       sparky_init.py - user initialization file
#
# Typically a user has a sparky_init.py file in ~/Sparky/Python.
# If they don't then this file (which does nothing) is loaded.
