<h1>
Protein Backbone Assignment using Spin Graphs
</h1>

<p>
Below I describe how Sparky can be used with AutoAssign to
assign the backbone of a small protein, BPTI.  This was presented as a
poster at the "Computational Aspects of Biomolecular NMR" conference in Pisa
in June 1999.  
<a href="extensions.html#AutoAssign">Details</a>
of how to obtain AutoAssign and use it with Sparky
appear in the Extensions section of the Sparky manual.
</p>

<h2>
Abstract
</h2>

<p>
Software to automate resonance assignment of proteins has not been
widely adopted.  Such programs can significantly reduce the time required
for assignment, a tedious and time consuming step in NMR studies of
protein structure and dynamics.  A difficult aspect of automated methods
is assimilating the results.  It is necessary to check the assignment
for errors and omissions.  A second impediment is that current programs
deduce assignments from lists of peak positions.  They have difficulty
achieving results as complete as hand assignment because they do not have
direct access to the spectra.  To address these limitations I have united a
graphical manual assignment program, Sparky, and an automated protein
backbone assignment
code called AutoAssign.  The key new feature of this system is a diagram
called a spin graph.  A spin graph represents atoms as dots and assigned
peaks as lines connecting the dots.  It provides an intuitive and detailed
display of generated assignments.  The tight integration of Sparky and
AutoAssign allows a cycle of revising peak lists and computing assignments
to be done in tens of seconds.  The spectroscopist adds and deletes peaks
based on flaws in the previously computed assignments and direct examination
of contoured spectra.  Tests of the Sparky / AutoAssign software on 58
residue Basic Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI) protein suggest that
this combination of tools may offer substantial time savings for protein
backbone assignment.  This approach is expected to result in assignments
that are as complete as those obtained with traditional methods.
Application to more realisitic protein systems is necessary to better
assess the usefulness of this software.

<h2>
Assigning BPTI
</h2>

<p>
The following is a walk through of the backbone assignment process
for the 58 residue protein BPTI using the Sparky and AutoAssign programs.
</p>

<h2>
Referencing the spectra
</h2>

<p>
I start with 8 processed spectra, a 2D N15 HSQC, and 7 triple resonance
spectra: HNCO, HNCA, CA(CO)NH, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNHA, HA(CO)NH.  This is
the preferred set of spectra for running AutoAssign.  It is possible to
work with fewer spectra, omitting the HNCO and the two HA spectra.  The
spectra can be processed with Bruker software, Varian's VNMR, NMRPipe from
the NIH, or Felix.
</p>

<p>
The first step is to align the spectra.  This is done
by shifting the spectrum ppm scales so that corresponding peaks in the
spectra are aligned.  This is necessary when the referencing information
used in processing the spectra is not consistent.  You use the Sparky
spectrum tool (accerlator st) to enter shifts for individual spectrum
axes.  I do this by first shifting the H and N axes of the triple resonance
spectra so that their peak line up with the HSQC peaks.  Then I shift the CA
axes so that peaks in CA strips line up.  Then I adjust the HA axes.  To
determine the numerical shifts in ppm I find corresponding strong peaks in two
spectra,
pick them, and take the difference of their chemical shift positions as
shown in peak lists (accerator lt).  For aligning the H and N axes of the
triple resonance spectra with the HSQC it is helpful to project the 3D
spectra onto the HN plane.  You can create a 2D projected spectrum with the
ucsfdata program using a command like:
</p>

<pre>
	% ucsfdata -s1 256 -r -o hnca2hn.ucsf hnca.ucsf
</pre>

<p>
This command projects the along the CA axis of the HNCA spectrum,
in this case it is axis w1 having 256 data points.  Executing ucsfdata
without any arguments will give a summary of the options.  The alignment
of the ppm axes described above does not establish absolute ppm scales.
You need a reference peak of known chemical shift to do this.  It is
desirable to establish absolute referencing because AutoAssign and some
Sparky tools use chemical shift statistics to help guess assignments.
</p>

<h2>
Picking Peaks
</h2>

<img src="images/n15hsqc.gif" alt="N15 HSQC" align=top>

<p>
Above is shown the N15 HSQC spectrum.  I interactively adjust contour
levels and pick peaks above a specified threshold and minimum linewidths.
For the triple resonance spectra I pick peaks that are sufficiently close
in the amide H and N dimensions to picked HSQC peaks.  This is done with
the restricted peak picking extension (accerator kr).  Limitting the picked
region of the 3D spectra allows me to use lower thresholds while keeping
the number of noise and artifact peaks small.  This process produces a total
of about 750 peaks in 30 minutes.  Most of the time is spent adjusting
thresholds and repicking to obtain approximately the expected number of peaks.
</p>

<h2>
Running AutoAssign
</h2>

<img src="images/run-autoassign.gif" alt="Run AutoAssign" align=top>

<p>
Next I run AutoAssign to generate backbone assignments.  AutoAssign
was created by Gaetano Montelione's group at Rutgers and is described
in a paper "Automated Analysis of Protein NMR Assignments Using Methods
from Artificial Intelligence", J. Mol. Biol. (1997) 269, 592-610.
It has a user interface which displays text lists of assignment
information and scatter plots.  I don't make use of this interface.
Instead, I treat the program as a black box invoked by the dialog
shown above.  The picked peaks and a set of chemical shift tolerances
are the only inputs.  The program runs for about 5 seconds and generates
backbone resonance assignments.  Peak assignments are automatically
inferred from the resonance assignments and displayed.
</p>

<h2>
Viewing Assignments
</h2>

<p>
Peak assignments are displayed as a spin graph.  This is the novel
element of the software I am describing and much of what follows will
describe how it is used to arrive at a final set of resonances assignments.
</p>

<img src="images/g28-2d.gif" alt="Spin Graph Example 1" align=top>

<p>
A spin graph shows atoms as dots connected by lines which represent
assigned peaks.  The above picture shows the amide H, N and CA atoms
of glycine residue 28 of BPTI.  The line connecting the amide proton
and nitrogen represents an assigned HSQC peak.
</p>

<img src="images/g28-3d.gif" alt="Spin Graph Example 2" align=top>

<p>
An assigned peak in a 3D spectra is shown as two lines.  The example
above shows an HNCA peak connecting the amide proton and nitrogen
to the alpha carbon.
</p>

<img src="images/g28-key.gif" alt="Color key" align=top>

<p>
The color of the line indicates which spectrum the assigned peak
comes from.
</p>

<img src="images/g28-both.gif" alt="Spin Graph Example 3" align=top>

<p>
Peaks from multiple spectra can be shown in the same diagram.
</p>

<h2>
Assignments for BPTI
</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="images/color-key-8.gif" alt="Color Key" align=top>
<td>
<img src="images/c30.gif" alt="Spin Graph 1" align=top>
</table>

<p>
The above spin graph shows the BPTI assignments generated
by running AutoAssign.  The 58 residues of BPTI are layed out in a
single row and you can scroll from one end to the other.  Only the
assignable backbone atoms are shown.  The 8 different line colors
indicate peak assignments from the 8 spectra.
</p>

<img src="images/y35.gif" alt="Spin Graph 2" align=top>

<p>
No assignments are made for some residues.  Sometimes this is because
a small stretch of residues is bounded by prolines.  In other cases
the peaks needed for assignment are below the spectrum noise level.
About 75% of the backbone resonances are assigned without any modifications
to the automatically picked peak lists.  A few residues are given
incorrect assignments.  About half the unassigned resonances cannot be
assigned using the available spectra.
</p>

<h2>
Fixing Assignment Errors
</h2>

<img src="images/k15-problem.gif" alt="K15 Problem" align=top>

<p>
The spin graph above shows that no assignments were made for proline 13
and the assignments for cysteine 14 and lysine 15 are incomplete.  I
investigate this problem by starting with the lysine 15 alpha and beta
carbon resonances and directly examining the spectra to verify the
lysine 15 assignments.
</p>

<img src="images/strips.gif" alt="Strip Plot" align=top>

<p>
I first display the peaks connecting the solidly assigned A16 residue to
the CA and CB of K15.  The first 3 strips show the CBCACONH, HNCACB and HNCA
spectra for alanine 16.  Next I selected the CA peak shown with the square
box around it in the first strip, and request all HNCACB strips with a peak
having matching carbon shift.  The seven rightmost strips are displayed.
The strip with amide H shift 8.001 and N shift 115.5 has a peak matching
the CB peak of alanine 16 but it has not been picked.
</p>

<img src="images/k15-fixed.gif" alt="K15 Fixed" align=top>

<p>
I pick the unmarked peak identified with the strip plots above and rerun
AutoAssign.
The new assignments are displayed in about 15 seconds.  The one additional
peak allows AutoAssign to correctly assign residues P13 through K15.
</p>

<h2>
Completing the Assignments
</h2>

<p>
Three additional locations along the BPTI backbone require direct inspection
of the spectra similar to what was illustrated above to improve peak lists.
After fixing those problems a few gaps remain in the assignments.
</p>

<img src="images/s47-gap.gif" alt="S47 Gap" align=top>

<p>
The spin graph above shows a gap between residues K46 and S47.
</p>

<img src="images/s47-list.gif" alt="S47 List" align=top>

<p>
I click on the spin graph S47 H atom and the above list of plausible
assignments is displayed.  Three groups of assignments are shown.
The top line of each group lists a proposed resononance assignment
and the subsequent lines show peak assignments consistent with the
resonance assignment.  The groups are ordered by the number of supporting
peak assignments.
</p>

<img src="images/s47-fixed.gif" alt="S47 Fixed" align=top>

<p>
I select the top line of the proposed assignments in the above list
and press Assign.  I similarly assign S47 HA and K46 C getting the
assignments shown in the spin graph above.  Why didn't AutoAssign
make these assignments?  I don't know.  The algorithm is sufficiently
complex that it is difficult to explain all of its behavior.  It is important
that the program can be treated as a black box and tools are available
to complete assignments by hand.
</p>

<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>

<p>
Combining graphical tools supporting traditional assignment methods that
make direct use of spectra with automated assignment software lets the
NMR spectroscopist focus on difficult to assign residues.
Spin graph display of automatic assignment results is an effective
means of locating the difficult to assign residues.  The Sparky / AutoAssign
combination will need to be tested on more realistic data sets to assess
the time savings resulting from this approach.  I would like to provide
Sparky interfaces to other automatic assignment programs for both protein
backbone and side chain assignments.
