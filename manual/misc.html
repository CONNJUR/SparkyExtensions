<h2>
<a name="FontSize">Changing Font Size</a>
</h2>

<p>
You can change the font size and style used for buttons, labels, menus,
peak lists, ... by adding some lines to your ~/.Xdefaults file.  The fonts
you specify override the defaults specifed in the Sparky option database
/usr/local/sparky/lib/Sparky.  You can look in that file for other options
you may want to override.  The lines to specify fonts that you add to your
.Xdefaults files should look like:
</p>

<pre>
	sparky.normalFont:	-family lucida -size 12
	sparky.fixedWidthFont:	-family lucidatypewriter -size 12
</pre>

<p>
You should then execute the command "xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults" so that
the X server reloads the .Xdefaults file, and then restart Sparky.  You
will not need to run the xrdb command in the future.  Every time you
log in the .Xdefaults files is read.  The font sizes are specified in
points (1/72 of an inch).  To see what font families and sizes are available
you can use the xlsfonts command (if it is available on your system).
The fixedWidthFont line should name a font that has a fixed width per
character.  It is used in peak lists so that columns line up.  To adjust
the size of assignment labels on contour plots you use the ornament size
dialog in Sparky (oz).

<h2>
<a name="ObsoleteFeatures">Obsolete Sparky (pre-1995) features</a>
</h2>

<p>
Sparky no longer has:
</p>

<ul>
<li>contour cache files
<li>bitmaps images
<li>buttons on the spectrum view windows
</ul>

<p>
The spectrum window buttons correspond to keyboard accelerators.
Zoom in is zi, zoom out is zo, zoom previous is zp, toggle resonance
panels is vR, toggle slice panels is vS.
</p>

<p>
The files in the DB directory are no longer used by Sparky.  This means
that resonance frequencies are calculated by averaging the positions of
assigned peaks in spectra in your project.  Peaks in spectra which are
not part of your project no longer effect resonance frequencies.
</p>

<p>
The accelerators for ornament copy and paste have changed from ec and ep
to oc and op.
</p>

<p>
There are no longer separate integration methods for isolated and
overlapped peaks.  You choose a single
<a href="peaks.html#Integration">integration method</a>
from the integration dialog (accelerator it).
</p>

<p>
The
<a href="peaks.html#AssignmentDialog">assignment dialog</a>
is different from pre-1995 Sparky.
</p>

<p>  
View synchronization is now done with a
<a href="views.html#ViewSync">synchronization dialog</a>.
The accelerators ya, yd, and yt all bring up this dialog.
You can now synchronize individual axes instead of all corresponding
axes between two or more spectra.
